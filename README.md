# VirtualRealityClassroom
 Classroom simulation in Virtual Reality with voice command integtration.
 
 
## Overview ##
VR Classroom is a continuation project, started by Jason Oehlberg, that is being developed for Northeastern State University's College of Education. This version of the project aimed to build upon some of the groundwork layed out in the previous version.

## Motivation ##
The College of Education is looking for a software that their students could access and act out different scenarios as an instructor of a class in a virtual enivironment. The user would resolve school oriented conflicts that would arise within the class using verbal communication. The user would then describe what happened in the situation and why. This virtual simulation would help students within the College of Education to hone their skills as educators and help prepare them for a job within education.

## Other Implications ##
The use of virtual simulation software could be applied to a wide array of job training within the work-force industry. This kind of training could help prepare workers for high-risk environments such as electrical, construction, heavy-machinery, or even space exploration.

## Architecture ##

All modelling for this project was made within Lucidhart.

The preliminary use case was made to help view the different goals that primary and secondary actors needed to achieve.

The swim lane activity diagram shows the main processes of the classroom scene and how actors handle different actions.

The speech script model is an overview of the structure of the speech recognition script and how it determines which way the students respond.


## Key Features ## 

 - Updated environment with added classrooms for future builds
 - Adjusted frame rate for smoother rendering between frames (reduces motion sickness)
 - Menu screen with options
 - Wall menu for restarting or exiting application
 - Added sound reactions to voice commands
 - Speech command integration
 
## Outcomes ##

The results of this project consisted of an executable file program able to be run by any Oculus Rift S device that has been enabled to run apps that are not form the Oculus store. User-friendly functionality has been increased with the implementation of menu and option screens as well as the adjusted frame-rate to help reduce motion sickness. Voice integratin still needs work so that phrases can be recognized rather than individually spoken words.
